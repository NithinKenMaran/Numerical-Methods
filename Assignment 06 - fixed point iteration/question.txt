It is possible to find the root of a polynomial f(x) - x = 0 by iterating x = f(x).

Practice

Use simple fixed point iteration to find the roots of f(x) = exp(-x) -x. Define a convergence criterion (% change in the root) and exit the iteration. Attempt Problem 6.1 from your text book Assignment - The logistic map is a discrete time demographic model written as x[n+1] = r x[n] (1-x[n])

Iterate the equation for the parameter range r = [0,4] with x between 0 and 1. Save the data as two columns (r,x), plot it (gnuplot is efficient) to generate the bifurcation plot Submit:

rollnum_logistic.c with command line inputs for Niter, rstep and error, and a jpg image of the final bifurcation plot
