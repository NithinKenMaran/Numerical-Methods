For the same problem that you solved using Newton and Lagrangian interpolating polynomials, find f(x) using cubic spline interpolation. Set up the simultaneous equtions to determine the unknown coefficients, and solve them using your Gaussian elimination code (from a previous assignment) Filename: rollnum_cubicspline.c Input: poly_order x0 Output: f(x0)
